# digital-clock
Explanation:

This version of the code combines the CSS styling and JavaScript logic into the HTML file using the <style> and <script> tags. The JavaScript code defines an arrow function that updates the clock display by retrieving the current time using the Date object, formatting it as a localized time string, and setting the innerHTML of the clock div to the time string. The setInterval function is used to call the arrow function every 1000 milliseconds to update the clock display in real-time. The comments in the code explain what each part of the code does.
